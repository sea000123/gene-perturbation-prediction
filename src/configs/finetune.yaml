# scGPT Finetuning Configuration for VCC Perturbation Prediction
# Based on scGPT Tutorial_Perturbation.ipynb
# This config is used for BOTH training and evaluation

# ========== Paths ==========
paths:
  # Pretrained model directory (used for training)
  model_dir: "model/scGPT"
  
  # Finetuned model directory (output for training, input for eval)
  finetuned_model_dir: "model/scGPT_finetuned"
  
  # Evaluation data paths
  data_dir: "data/processed"
  test_file: "test.h5ad"
  train_file: "train.h5ad"
  
  # Evaluation results output
  output_dir: "results"
  
  # GEARS data directory (for training, created by scripts/convert_to_gears.py)
  gears_data_dir: "data/processed/gears"
  dataset_name: "vcc"

# ========== Model ==========
# Common model settings used by both training and evaluation
model:
  pad_token: "<pad>"
  pad_value: 0
  max_seq_len: 1536
  include_zero_gene: "batch-wise"  # "batch-wise" uses less memory than "all"
  
  # Architecture (overridden by pretrained model config args.json during training)

# ========== Data Processing (Training) ==========
data:
  special_tokens: ["<pad>", "<cls>", "<eoc>"]
  pert_pad_id: 0

# ========== Training Objectives ==========
training:
  # Primary objective (always on for perturbation)
  MLM: true   # Masked Language Modeling
  
  # Optional objectives (disabled for perturbation finetuning)
  CLS: false  # Cell type classification
  CCE: false  # Contrastive cell embedding
  MVC: false  # Masked value prediction for cell embedding
  ECS: false  # Elastic cell similarity
  
  # Mixed precision training
  amp: true

# ========== Optimizer ==========
optimizer:

  train_ratio: 0.833  # 100/120 genes for training
  val_ratio: 0.167    # 20/120 genes for validation
  seed: 42

# ========== Metrics ==========
metrics:
  mae_top_k: 2000  # Top K genes by |log2FC| for MAE calculation

# ========== Early Stopping ==========
early_stopping:
  metric: "l_geo"  # 1 - s_geo, where s_geo = (s_pds * s_mae * s_des)^(1/3)

# ========== Logging ==========
logging:
  log_interval: 100
  save_interval: 1  # Save every epoch

# ========== Hardware ==========
hardware:
  # Detected automatically, but can override
  device: "cuda"  # "cuda" or "cpu"
